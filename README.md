Squa.sh
=======

This is a simple brakeout/pong like game without bricks, and resembles the 
game of squash. The game's name is a pun on the fact that it is written
in pure shellscript. Please enjoy!

The game itself isn't so much fun to play at all, but it was a whole lot of 
fun to write.

There only two things you can do in the game:
- move your paddle left or right with the arrow keys
- quit the game by pressing the `q` key


__Note__: I blatantly stole the idea and even the name of the game from 
[here](http://isquared.nl/blog/2009/04/19/squa.sh/), 
but I did write the game from scratch.
